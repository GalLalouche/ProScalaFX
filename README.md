ProScalaFX
==========

[Pro JavaFX2](http://www.apress.com/9781430268727/) book source codes translated to [ScalaFX](http://code.google.com/p/scalafx/).
Original JavaFX code can be downloaded from [here](http://www.apress.com/downloadable/download/sample/sample_id/1253/).

Build script (build.sbt) is intended for Java 7, though examples should work with Java 8 too (you will need to use ScalaFX 8 for Java 8).
